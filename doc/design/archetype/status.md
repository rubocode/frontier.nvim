## THE STATUS ARCHETYPE
> JUL 26, 2025

This — again — was added during moving from _lualine_
to _mini.  There was the need to specify colors for
sections (parts) of the status line and there were
duplicates.

So a more meaningful set of definitions were introduced
named _Normal_, _Loud_, and _Quiet_.
They were then used to define Chasnovski's parameters.
They may have other uses later.
Let's wait and see!
