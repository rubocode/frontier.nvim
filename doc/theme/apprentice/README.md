ORIGIN: [**Romain Lafourcade**](https://github.com/romainl)  
PALETTE: [apprentice.colortemplate](apprentice.colortemplate)  

* It was developed with _vimscript_ with slightly different design goals.
* The major plus point was that it looked exactly the same on both xterm256 and truecolor terminals.
* It was intentionally easy on the eyes.
* It did quite well with a very small color palette, achieving an elegant simplicity.

I loved the theme except for the very bright yellow primarily used for function highlighting.

* The designer had decided to go with the very bright NEOVIM defaults for diagnostics and signs.
* The LSP diagnostic messages were not mixing well with the colorscheme.

I needed further customization than _apprentice_ offered.
But it was a wonderful example.
