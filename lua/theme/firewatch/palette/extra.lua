-- FIREWATCH EXTRA PALETTE
-- JUL 28, 2025

-- This extra palette was added to supply
-- a much needed lighter black for the canvas.
-- Ir was difficult to get the menus to appear
-- distinct and at the same time not too light.

local aux = require("palette.xterm256.auxiliary")

local M = {
	canvas = {
		Lighter = aux.Grey7,
	},
}

return M
