## TWO-FIREWATCH COLORSHEME

This [colorscheme](two-firewatch.vim) was developed in **vimscript** by
[**Ramzi Akremi**](https://github.com/rakr).

He was primarily targeting a refined visual experience on truecolor terminals.
But when I ran it on the macOS Terminal, it looked excellent.
So I studied the theme.

I wanted to be able to understand how to create a personalized colorscheme
for myself mainly because most of the popular colorschemes such as **catppuccin**
and **tokyonight** had too many colors and were rather distracting.

My original goal was to code **golang** and a simple colorscheme would have
sufficed.

I wanted to create a new one using **Lua** instead of **vimscript** which
will allow me to learn to use **Lua** in a real life project.
