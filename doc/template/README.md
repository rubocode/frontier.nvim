Apprentice had a published color template but I didn't pursue that at the time I found it.
Today, I discovered that vim colortemplates are going to become a standard.

This would be good especially if I wanted to fall back to a 16 color terminal default.
It is useful to remember that the neovim standard palette has a handful more colors than sixteen.

This would be interesting to chew on at a later point.
I must get the 256 color abstraction working before I consider fall back to 16 color.
Good stuff though!
