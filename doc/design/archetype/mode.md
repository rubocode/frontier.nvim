## THE MODE ARCHETYPE
> JUL 26, 2025

This archetype was identified when I wanted to switch from
_lualine_ to _mini.statusline_.  You could customize how your
editing mode — indicated at the bottom left — should look
like.

However, the editing mode is not speific to just _mini.statusline_.
It is a fundamental concept in the problem domain.
Therefore, it was made a vital archetype among the chosen few.
We have definitions for _Command_, _Insert_, _Normal_, _Other_,
_Replace_ and _Visual_ modes.

There are _Text_ and _Line_ versions as well.
