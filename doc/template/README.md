## COLOR TEMPLATES

Apprentice had a published color template but I didn't pursue that at the time I found it.
Today, I discovered that vim colortemplates are going to become a standard.

This would be good especially if I wanted to fall back to a 16 color terminal default.
It is useful to remember that the neovim standard palette has a handful more colors than sixteen.

This would be interesting to chew on at a later point.
I must get the 256 color abstraction working before I consider falling back to 16 color.
Good stuff though!

Color templates solve only half of the problem.  That of identifying and selecting a color
palette.  Linking those colors to the highlight groups is the other half.

The reason the latter can't be standardized is because you will always have new plugins
with new highlight groups.

So, colorscheme creation will remain a cottage industry.
