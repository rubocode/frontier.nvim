The above is where all the standard highlight groups are defined.
The copy of [vim.lua](vim.lua) in this local folder is a snapshot taken on JUL 10, 2025.

This removes a lot of confusion and provides a good understanding of how the defaults
were meant to be linked together which helps you avoid unnecessary explicit redefitions
of many different highlight groups.
