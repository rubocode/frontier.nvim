## FRONTIER COLORSCHEME
> JUL 19, 2025

Initially, I just wanted to create a new colorscheme that I would personally
use on a daily basis.  This happened because I could not find one that I liked
enough.  The handful I found appealing were legacy implementations using
_vimscript_ and did not include adequate support for more recent additions
such as LSP.

* I needed it to work on the macOS (xterm256) terminal.
* I needed a way to fully customize my experience.
* I was only going to use a handful of programming languages to begin with.

I was new to _lua_ but I was happy that it was simpler, elegant and
more expressive than _vimscript_.  Not only was I learning _lua_ but
I was also trying to figure out how to integrate a colorscheme into _neovim_.
I also didn't know how colorschemes for neovim were organized.
So, what I had infront of me was an _experiment_ where I would work in
[bottom up](https://rubocode.github.io/blog/2018-08-17/top-down-and-bottom-up)
fashion from a prototype to a finished product.

* [Requirement](requirement.md)
* [Approach](approach.md)
* [Goals](goals.md)
* [Elements](elements.md)
* [Strategy](strategy.md)
* [Philosophy](philosophy.md)
* [Colors](colors.md)
* [Tangent](tangent.md)

This could be quite useful and interesting!
