## TWO-FIREWATCH THEME

This [colorscheme](two-firewatch.vim) was developed in **vimscript** by
[**Ramzi Akremi**](https://github.com/rakr).

He was primarily targeting a refined visual experience on truecolor terminals.
But when I ran it on the macOS Terminal, it looked excellent and more importantly
it didn't go into the broken CRT TV mode.  So I studied the theme.

I wanted to be able to understand how to create a personalized colorscheme
for myself mainly because most of the popular colorschemes such as **catppuccin**
and **tokyonight** had too many colors for my taste and more improtantly didn't
work on the macOS Terminal.  This is where the constraint to use only the
xterm256 colors was established.

My original goal was to code **golang** and a simple colorscheme would have
sufficed.

I wanted to create a new one using **Lua** instead of **vimscript** which
will allow me to learn to use **Lua** in a real life project.
