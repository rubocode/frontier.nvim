## FRONTIER COLORSCHEME
> JUL 19, 2025

Initially, I just wanted to create a new colorscheme that I would personally
use on a daily basis.  This happened because I could not find one that I liked
enough.

I was new to _lua_ but I was happy that it was more expressive than _vimscript_.
Not only was I learning lua but I was also trying to figure out how to integrate
a colorscheme into _neovim_.  I also didn't know how colorschemes for neovim were
organized.  So, what I had infront of me was an _experiment_ where I would work
in [bottom up](https://rubocode.github.io/blog/2018-08-17/top-down-and-bottom-up)
fashion from a prototype to a finished product.

* [Origin](origin.md)
* [Requirement](requirement.md)
* [Approach](approach.md)
* [Goals](goals.md)
* [Elements](elements.md)
* [Strategy](strategy.md)
* [Philosophy](philosophy.md)

This could be quite useful and interesting!
