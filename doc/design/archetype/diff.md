## THE DIFF ARCHETYPE
> JUL 26, 2025

This one is rather straight-forward.
This is the set of colors that signal changes.
They are very useful in displaying changes
in files compared to previous versions in _git_.

There are other uses for the same and I wanted
to have the essential ingredients in one place.
It defines _Add_, _Change_, _Delete_ and _Text_.

It needs special mention that many of the legacy
colorschemes I had found appealing had not bothered
to include colors for this in their palette.
They drifted along with the _neovim_ defaults
which were _too loud_ for my taste.

Now that a rather durable color definition of this
is available, it doesn't even need to be defined
by a new or legacy colorscheme â€” it will be an
excellent default to _have_ and to _use_.
It is good to keep in mind that you cannnot _hold_
color arrangements. ;)
