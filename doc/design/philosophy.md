## PHILOSOPHY 
> JUL 23, 2025

Ultimately, it would be a waste of your life to spend it attempting
to design elegant aesthetics for the multitude.
Tastes vary and you can't make everyone happy.
So, you pick the simpler and the more pragmatic approach.
You try to do something that delights you, all the way
under carefully chosen design constraints.
Anyone who likes it can enjoy it for free, thanks to open source.
If no one else does, you still made one that you would gladly use!

The design challenge now becomes one of creating an accurate internal
asbtraction that is congruent with the problem at hand to eliminate
impedance mismatches.  The better you understand the neovim highlight
group design and classification, the better you can factor the internal
abstraction.  The better your internal abstraction, the better your
representation of aesthetics in the problem domain.

The the better your internal abstraction, the better the semantics.
The better the semantics, the better the defaults.
The better the defaults, the lesser you need to customize.
The lesser you need to customize, the lesser the number of outer variables.
All of a sudden, you can quickly experiment with colors and have that
instantly show you how the the technicalities are impacted.
This facilitates rapid infusion of the creative and the aesthetic aspects.

You have just increased your productivity via intelligent automation.
Now, your outlook on life might differ.
You could very well prefer to ask _ChatGPT_ to do this for you.
Then again, you just might enjoy creating a design that pleases you.
That gives you a better feeling than the one you get by becoming
a _prompt engineer_.  You could become a _prompt_ engineer instead.
