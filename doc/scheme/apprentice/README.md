This colorscheme was created by [**Romain Lafourcade**](https://github.com/romainl).

It was developed with **vimscript** with slightly different design goals.

I loved the colorscheme except for the very bright yellow for keywords.

So I still needed top be able to fully customize my colorscheme and have it look
the same on macOS Terminal and WezTerm.
