## THE CANVAS ARCHETYPE
> JUL 26, 2025

This archetype is where our choice of background colors reside.
We are drawing on a canvas.

As we have decided to constrain ourselves to _dark_ themes,
the semantics become more focused.
The colors exist at the extreme _black_ end of the _grey_
spectrum.

We have three options in background color - _Normal_,
_Lighter_ and _Darker_.
It is very useful to define the _Normal_ background to be
mildly lighter than absolute black.
Access to a darker background color gives us adavantage on
better aesthetic options.  For example, the sign column where
file edit differences with the previous version commited to
_git_ on the _frontier_ theme is darker than the _Normal_
background color.

As another example, these three color options come in handy
when defining _statusline_, _menus_ and third party _plugins_.
